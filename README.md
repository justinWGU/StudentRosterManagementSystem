# StudentRosterManagementSystem

*** Student Roster Management System ***

This C++ project manages student data efficiently by allowing users to add, 
remove, and display student records, validate email addresses, and calculate 
average course completion times. It also filters students by degree programs. 
The system demonstrates key skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, 
and error handling. This project was developed as a school assignment to showcase 
proficiency in C++ and software development best practices.
